# LeetCode Practice (Python)
This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of solving LeetCode problems using Python. LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding interview questions, and this project aims to improve my problem-solving skills and keep me consistent in my coding practice. The project contains the Python scripts for each LeetCode problem I've solved.

## Goals
Starting from 11th August 2024, I am commited to complete at least 3 questions every week. The topics of the questions include array, hashing, two pointers, stack, binary search, linked list, sliding window, trees, heap, queue, priority queue, graphs, dynamic programming and etc.
